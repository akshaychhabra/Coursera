# Coursera
This will serve as a repository of all the Coursera courses attended by me. 

<b>Disclaimer:</b> All the course material in this repository including video lectures are the sole property of the individual/group/university offering the course in conjunction with Coursera.This is merely a place for hosting this publicly available information and is not an attempt to claim/plagiarise the content. In fact I'm very thankful to all the people involved with offering this content for free because without them a lot of the things that I have learned would not be possible.
